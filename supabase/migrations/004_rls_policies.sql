-- - Simple policies for admin code (like original)
-- - API-friendly policies for member features

CREATE POLICY "Anyone authenticated can insert projects"

CREATE POLICY "Anyone authenticated can update projects"
    ON public.projects FOR UPDATE
    USING (true);  -- Admin code expects this to work

CREATE POLICY "Anyone authenticated can delete projects"
    ON public.projects FOR DELETE

-- Project contributors - simple policies for admin compatibility

-- Note: Security is handled at the application layer:
-- - API routes validate auth tokens
-- - Admin pages check user roles
-- - Member pages only show their own data
